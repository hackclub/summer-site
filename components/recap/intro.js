      In 1967, 100,000 people gathered in San Francisco for the Summer of Love.
      In 2020, we at Hack Club hosted the Summer of Making. It wasn't an event
      or a program. <span className="highlight">It was a theme for the summer and a challenge for students
      to take on.</span> It was also a summer like no other, with hackers around the
      world stuck at home. To support makers, we distributed $50,000 in free
      electronics (thanks GitHub!) & built Snapchat streaks for codingâ€”<span className="highlight">but
      really Summer of Making was about the makers</span>. We left it them to get
      hacking & they built some pretty awesome things...
