      As part of Summer of Making we built Scrapbook. The idea is to <span className ="highlight">share
      updates of what youâ€™re working on every day:</span> every day this summer, Hack
      Clubbers are learning & building projects, sharing short video or photo
      updates via a Slack channel. Through a Slack bot, an Airtable, & a Next.js
      website that makes everything browsable. The response was amazing and the
      site is <span className ="highlight">full of amazing things build this summer</span>.
    </Text>
  </Container>
