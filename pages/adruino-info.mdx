# About your Arduino Starter Kit

For starters, congrats on earning a kit! We're really excited to see what you make with yours!
These kits are made possible by the gracious support of [Github](https://github.com) & [Arduino](https://arduino.cc).
The aim of this document it to provide you with all the information you need about your grant.

### When will my kit arrive?

We will place your order within 48 hours of you submitting the form. You will receive a DM when Arduino ships it containing tracking info. It will arrive in anywhere from 3 days to 1 week if you are based in the US or Europe. International deliveries may take up to 2 and a half weeks. 

### How can I get my own referral codes?

To get your codes, you first need to make something. After making something share a photo of what you've built in your `#scrapbook`. Include a git repo link with photos + code and react with `:arduino-kit:`! You will be presented with further information then through a Slack Bot.

### What is my kit?

1 Projects Book (170 pages),

1 Arduino Uno & USB Cable

1 Breadboard 400 points & 70 Solid core jumper wires,

Loads of assorted electronic components!

Here is a [link to the product page for exact components.]()

### Who can I contact for more questions?

Please join `#hardware-party-questions` and ask a question there. A member of the Summer of Making team will assist you within 24 hours.

### Happy hacking!
