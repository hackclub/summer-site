53 years ago, 100,000 people gathered in San Francisco for what was later called the Summer of Love.

Welcome to the [Hack Club Summer of Making](https://hack.af/summer-of-making). It’s not an event, or a program with a start/end date. It’s a theme for the summer and a challenge to everyone reading this: this summer, what will you make? What will you learn? What will you build?

We’re doing a few big things to support you, including giving out \$50,000 in free electronics (thanks GitHub!) and building a Snapchat streaks-like system for learning, but really the Summer of Making is about you.

We don't want to descend from above with a "program" for you to do. If this is going to be the best summer ever, it'll be because of what you all choose to hack on & learn from.

Will you choose to push yourself outside your comfort zone, whether it's building your first website or a model rocket? What about using React.js for the first time or constructing a smart mirror?

At Hack Club, we're going to do everything we can to support you. There are four ways to get started:

1. **Get a Summer of Making sticker in the mail**: [Request one here](https://hack.af/som-stickers). We are printing thousands and will be shipping to everyone who requests.
2. **Have GitHub buy you electronics for your hardware project.** We are giving **\$50,000 in hardware grants** from GitHub to fund electronics projects. Applications are open today. [Learn more](https://hack.af/hwp-learn-more) and [apply with an idea](https://hack.af/hwp-apply). Priority is given to existing Hack Club members.
3. **Show up every day in** [**#scrapbook**](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD), sharing photo and video updates from your learning and getting a beautiful portfolio. See the in-progress projects at [**scrapbook.hackclub.com**](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/) ([see mine](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/zrl/)). You can even customize your CSS and set up a custom domain.
4. **Weekly Zoom events shared in** [**#announcements**](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT): All summer, [Melody](https://hack.af/som-melody) & others from the Hack Club team are running weekly live events, including coding workshops, show & tells, office hours, how to customize your [scrapbook](https://hack.af/som-scrapbook) with custom CSS, and more. [Log on the Hack Club Slack to participate.](https://hack.af/som-slack/)

It's a strange time. So why not make something?
